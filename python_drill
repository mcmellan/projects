#1. Assign an integer to a variable    
age = 29
#2. Assign a string to a variable
name ="Mc Mellan"
#3. Assign a float to a variable
coding_experience= 1.25 


def get_info(age, name, coding_experience ):
    print("My name is {1}. I am {0}. I have been studying coding for about {2} years.".format(age, name, coding_experience))

#4. Use the print function and .format() notation to print out the variable you assigned 

get_info(age, name, coding_experience)



#5. Use each of these operators +, - , * , / , +=, Â­= , %
x=7
y=10
z=6

print ((x + y)*  z)
print int((y - z)/x) 
print (y % x)

x+= 2

print (x)

#6. Use of logical operators: and, or, not
#7. Use of conditional statements: if, elif, else

age= 25

if age>18 and age<26:
    print("Congratulations, You are eligible for student discount")
elif age>26:
    print("Sorry, you are too old")
else:
    print "Wait a couple of years"

#8. Use of a while loop

speed =70

while speed<80:
  print(speed)
  speed=speed+2
  print ("Drive carefully, dont go too fast")

#9. Use of a for loop
  
for speed in range(70,80):
    print(speed)

#10. Create a list and iterate through that list using a for loop to print each item out on a new line

              "Windy",
              "Joyce",]
for friends in friends_list:
    print(friends)

#11. Create a tuple and iterate through it using a for loop to print each item out on a new line

friends_info=[("Desiree", "City: Rowland Heights", "Age: 27", "Status: Single"),
              ("Cammile","City: Rowland Heights", "Age: 29", "Status: Married"),

              ("Joyce", "City: DUarte", "Age: 24", "Status: Dating"),]
for friends_name in friends_info:
    print(friends_name)
    
#12. Define a function that returns a string variable
#13. Call the function you defined above and print the result to the shell
